# Instructions
# Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a 
# user's weight and height.
# The BMI is a measure of some's weight taking into account their 
# height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same 
# amount, the short person is usually more overweight.
# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square 
# of their height (in m):

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
# height = input("enter your height in m: ")
# weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
# bmi = float(weight) / (float(height) * float(height))
# print(round(bmi))


# Ex3
# I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised 
# just how little time we actually have. https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html
# Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, 
# months we have left if we live until 90 years old.
# It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in 
# this format:
#     You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.
# Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
# age = input("What is your current age?")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
# time_remaining = 90 - int(age)
# days = time_remaining * 365
# weeks = time_remaining * 52
# months = time_remaining * 12

# print(f"You have {days} days, {weeks} weeks, and {months} months left.")
