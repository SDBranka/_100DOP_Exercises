# Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

# It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

#     Under 18.5 they are underweight
#     Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
#     Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
#     Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
#     Above 35 they are clinically obese.

# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
# height = float(input("enter your height in m: "))
# weight = float(input("enter your weight in kg: "))
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

# Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year.
# A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February.
# The reason why we have leap years is really fascinating, this video does it more justice:
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX96xng7sAE
# This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.
#     on every year that is evenly divisible by 4 
#     **except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100 
#     **unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400
# e.g. The year 2000:
# 2000 Ã· 4 = 500 (Leap)
# 2000 Ã· 100 = 20 (Not Leap)
# 2000 Ã· 400 = 5 (Leap!)
# So the year 2000 is a leap year.
# But the year 2100 is not a leap year because:
# 2100 Ã· 4 = 525 (Leap)
# 2100 Ã· 100 = 21 (Not Leap)
# 2100 Ã· 400 = 5.25 (Not Leap)
# Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the 
# positions of the commas and full stops.

# Example Input 1
# 2400
# Example Output 1
# Leap year.

# Example Input 2
# 1989
# Example Output 2
# Not leap year.

# # ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
# year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))
# # ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

# #Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡
# if year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0:
#     print("Leap year.")
# else:
#     print("Not leap year.")

# You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.
# To work out the love score between two people:
#     Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters
#       in the word TRUE occurs. 
#     Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. 
#     Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.
# For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:
# "Your score is **x**, you go together like coke and mentos."
# For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:
# "Your score is **y**, you are alright together."
# Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:
# "Your score is **z**."
