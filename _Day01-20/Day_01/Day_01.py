# Ex1
# Example Output
# After you have written your code, you should run 
# your program and it should print the following:
# 
# Day 1 - Python Print Function
# The function is declared like this:
# print('what to print')

# print("Day 1 - Python Print Function\
#     \nThe function is declared like this:\
#     \nprint('what to print')")


# Ex2
# When you run your program, it should print the following:
# 
# Day 1 - String Manipulation
# String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.
# e.g. print("Hello " + "world")
# New lines can be created with a backslash and n.

# print('Day 1 - String Manipulation\
#     \nString Concatenation is done with the "+" sign\
#     \ne.g. print("Hello " + "world")\
#     \nNew lines can be created with a backslash and n.')


# Ex3
# Write a program that prints the number of characters
# in a user's name. You might need to Google for a function 
# that calculates the length of a string.

# print( len( input("What is your name?") ) )

# Ex4
# Write a program that switches the values stored in the variables a and b.

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
# a = input("a: ")
# b = input("b: ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
