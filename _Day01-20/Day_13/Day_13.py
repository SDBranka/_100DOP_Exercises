# The code needs to print the solution to the FizzBuzz game.
# Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.
# When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".
# When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".
# And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"
# Hint
# There is more than one fix required.
